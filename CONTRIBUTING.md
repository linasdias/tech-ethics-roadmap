## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Tech Ethics Roadmap Code of Conduct](https://github.com/linasdias/tech-ethics-roadmapblob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this roadmap. Please report unacceptable behavior
to [me](https://github.com/linasdias).


## I Have a Question

> If you want to ask a question, I assume that you have read the available [Documentation]().

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/linasdias/tech-ethics-roadmap/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, I recommend the following:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/linasdias/tech-ethics-roadmap/issues/new).
- Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
- Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

I will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Typos, Broken Links, Whatever

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting a Typo Report

A good report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Please complete the following steps in advance to help me fix any potential error as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if it's not an error on your side only (Internet connection, work firewall, etc).
- Check if there is not already a report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/linasdias/tech-ethics-roadmapissues?q=label%3Abug).
- Also make sure to search the internet to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### How Do I Submit a Good Report?

I use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/linasdias/tech-ethics-roadmap/issues/new). (Since I can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, I ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Tech Ethics Roadmap, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

<!-- omit in toc -->
#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Read the [documentation]() carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.
- Perform a [search](https://github.com/linasdias/tech-ethics-roadmap/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
- Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/linasdias/tech-ethics-roadmap/issues).

- Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
- Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
- **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
- You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux. <!-- this should only be included if the project has a GUI -->
- **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Tech Ethics Roadmap users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
